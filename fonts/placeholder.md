# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain all font files used in the website.

## Recommended Fonts
- Roboto (Regular, Bold)
- Poppins (SemiBold)

## Usage

Currently, the website uses Google Fonts which are linked directly in the HTML. If you prefer to host fonts locally:

1. Download the fonts from Google Fonts or another source
2. Place the font files in this directory
3. Update the CSS to use `@font-face` declarations instead of the Google Fonts links
